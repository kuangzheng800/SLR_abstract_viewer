METHODS: A randomly selected sample of patients with HIV-infection receiving follow-up care in the infectious diseases department of Bichat University Hospital was invited to participate in a systematic screening program consisting of anal examination with anoscopy and a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 516 patients, 473 (92 percent) participated. Overall, 208 patients (44 percent) had at least one anal macroscopic lesion: 108 patients (22.8 percent) had human papilloma (HPV)Yrelated lesions (condyloma with or without dysplasia), 67 (14.2 percent) had hemorrhoidal disease, 50 (10.6 percent) had anal fissures, and 44 (9.3) percent had other anal lesions. Independent significantly associated factors for anal condyloma were history of anal condyloma (OR, 2.09) and median number of episodes of sexual intercourse per month (OR, 1.03) in men who have sex with men; history of genital condyloma (OR, 26.74), and unprotected sexual intercourse (OR, 7.47) in heterosexual men; and CD4 cell count below 200/mm <sup>3</sup> (OR, 6.02), receptive anal intercourse (OR, 6.37), and history of anal condyloma (OR, 16.69) in women. Neither sexual behavior nor characteristics related to HIV infection were associated with hemorrhoidal disease or anal fissure. CONCLUSIONS: Because patients with HIV infections have a high prevalence of unreported anal lesions that may be highly contagious, involve risk of anal neoplasia, or negatively affect quality of life, systematic anal screening should be conducted in the HIV-infected population. ©The ASCRS 2009.","(Abramowitz, Benabderrahmane) AP HP, Department of Gastroenterology and Proctology, Bichat University Hospital, Paris, France (Baron) Department of Biostatistics, Bichat University Hospital, Paris 7 University, Paris, France (Walker) AP-HP, Department of Anatomopathology, Bichat University Hospital, Paris, France (Yeni, Duval) Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bichat University Hospital, Paris 7 University, Paris, France (Duval) Infectious Diseases Laboratory, Bichat University Hospital, Paris 7 University, Paris, France (Duval) INSERM Clinical Investigation Center 007, Bichat University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France (Abramowitz) Service de Gastroenterologie, Hopital Universitaire Bichat Claude Bernard, 46 Rue Henri Huchard, 75877 Paris, Cedex 18, France~L.

The optimal screening methods are not generally agreed. Method: Screening for anal lesions by anorectal examination, including anoscopy, was offered to HIV-positive outpatients in a tertiary care university hospital regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Results: Among the 1206 screened patients (701 MSM, 247 heterosexual men, 258 women), 311 (26%) had histologically proven lesions related to human papilloma virus (HPV) (34% MSM, 14% heterosexual men, 14% women); 123 (10%) had low-grade dysplasia and 70 (6%) high-grade dysplasia. Seven anal cancers were also diagnosed. Determinants of any lesion were age < 45 years [OR = 1.56 (95% CI, 1.16-2.11)], a CD4 count of < 200/mm<sup>3</sup> [OR = 2.54 (1.71-3.78)], receptive anal intercourse [OR =3.03 (2.06-4.47)], sub-Saharan African origin [OR = 0.53 (0.33-0.85)], and history of HPV-related lesion [OR = 1.84 (1.35-2.51)]. These determinants were similar for all different grades of dysplasia. In patient subgroup analysis, receptive anal intercourse, the CD4 cell count and a history of HPV lesions were determinants of HPV-positivity in all patients, whereas age was only a determinant in men. Conclusion: Anoscopy is an alternative method for anal screening in an HIV-positive population. This screening has to be compared with other tools in populations at high risk of anal cancer.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection seems to be associated with the occurrence of most cases. The genotype-specific prevalence of HPV in anal cancer was estimated to assess the potential benefit of HPV vaccination in France. Anal cancer histological specimens were retrospectively recruited in 2008 from 16 French centres and centrally tested for HPV genotyping using the INNO-LiPA assay allowing the detection of 28 genotypes. Results were analyzed according to age, gender, HIV status when available and histological diagnosis. A total of 366 anal cancer cases were analyzed among which 62% were females. Mean age at diagnosis was 54.8 years in males and 66.4 years in females (p <0.001). HPV was found in 96.7% of cases, 72% being infected by a single HPV type. Presence of at least one high-risk genotype was observed in 91% of cases (96% in females and 83% in males; p <0.001). HPV16 was by far the most prevalent genotype (75%), followed by HPV18, HPV52, HPV33, and HPV51 (4-6%). HPV16/18 alone or in association were found in 78% of all cases. HIV-positive cases had a higher proportion of multiple HPV infection than HIV-negative cases and a slightly different HPV type distribution with an under-representation of HPV16 and an over-representation of other types. Our results indicate that anal cancer rarely occurs in the absence of HPV and emphasize the predominant role of HPV16. The potential benefit of HPV vaccine on the occurrence of anal cancer should be further evaluated. © 2010 UICC.","(Abramowitz) APHP, Hopital Bichat, Service de Gastroenterologie et de Proctologie, 46 rue Henri Huchard, 75877 Paris, France (Jacquard, Jaroud, Haesebaert, Leocmach, Soubeyrand) Direction Medicale France, Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon, France (Siproudhis) Service d'Hepatogastroenterologie, Hopital Pontchaillou, Rennes, France (Pradat) Service d'Hepatogastroenterologie, Hotel-Dieu, Hospices Civils de Lyon, France (Pradat) IFR62 Lyon-Est, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, France (Pradat) Unite de recherche sur les hepatites, INSERM U871, Lyon, France (Aynaud) Service de Dermatologie, CHU Cochin, Paris, France (Dachez) Departement de pathologie, BIOMNIS, Paris-Lyon, France (Riethmuller, Mougin, Pretet) EA3181, IFR133, Universite de Franche-Comte, Besancon, France (Riethmuller) Service de Gynecologie-Obstetrique, CHU Saint Jacques, Besancon, France (Denis) Laboratoire de Bacteriologie et Virologie, CHU Dupuytren, Limoges, France~L.

A.","Prevalence and type distribution of human papillomavirus infection using the INNo-Lipa Assay, Kerman, Southeast Iran",Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,14,5287-5291,,,"The human papilloma virus (HPV) causes skin and mucous membrane infections. It crosses from one person to another by skin-to-skin contact, such as sexual contact. There are more than 100 types of HPV that can influence different parts of the body. Some types of HPV can cause cancer (such as cervical or anal cancer) and others can cause warts (such as genital or plantar warts). HPV infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Iran and around the world. Considerable molecular evidence suggests a role for human papilloma virus (HPV) in the pathogenesis of carcinoma. Epidemiological studies on human papilloma viruses (HPVs) infections in general population are critical for the performing of health policy guidelines for developing the strategies to hinder the primary and secondary different cancer. In different parts of Iran, there is a lack of population-based studies to determine the prevalence of HPV in the general population. The aim of this population-based study was therefore to report the prevalence ratse of HPV types among Iranian patients. To study the risk of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, we managed a retrospective study in Kerman province, southeast of Iran. For this purpose, 410 patients tested for the presence of HPV DNA using PCR and INNo- Lipa assays. HPV DNA was detected in 108 out of 410 patients (26.34%), while it was not detected in any of the control group samples. Patients included 23 (21.1%) males and 86 (78.8%) females. HPV type 6 was the most common (49%) followed by HPV type 16 (10.1%), and also HPV type11 (9.2%). The prevalence of HPV in Iran is comparable to those reported in other regions of the world. In a similar manner, it seems that HPV types 6, 16 and11 are the most common types in Kerman. Additional studies on larger group of patients, particularly in those with pre-invasive forms of disease, are needed to explain the roles of different HPV types in this location of Iran.","(Afshar) Research Center for Tropical and Infectious Diseases, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran, Islamic Republic of (Mollaie, Fazlalipour) Department of Medical Virology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of (Arabzadeh) Department of Medical Virology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran, Islamic Republic of~H.R.

Vaccinating men against human papillomavirus (HPV) can prevent penile, anal, and oral cancers, anogenital warts, and the transmission of HPV to their sexual partners. This study characterized HPV acquisition among male military members by evaluating both seroprevalence at entry into service and seroincidence of HPV infection after ten years of service. At entry, 29 of 200 (14.5%) male service members were positive for HPV serotypes 6, 11, 16, or 18. Of 199 initially seronegative for at least one of the four HPV serotypes, 68 (34.2%) seroconverted to one or more serotypes at ten years; more than one-third of these were seropositive for oncogenic HPV serotypes. This estimate of HPV seroprevalence among male military accessions is higher than that reported among U.S. civilian males. Vaccination to prevent genital warts and cancers resulting from HPV infection may decrease health care system burdens. Further analyses are warranted to understand the potential costs and benefits of a policy to vaccinate male service members.","(Agan) Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program, Department of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.~B.K.

Genital HPV prevalence in men appears to vary by world region with men residing in Asia having among the lowest prevalence. Unfortunately, there is little information on prevalence of HPV infection in men by race. The purpose of this study was to examine HPV prevalence by race across three countries. 3,909 men ages 18-70 years enrolled in an ongoing prospective cohort study of the natural history of HPV in men (The HIM Study) were included in the analysis. Participants completed risk factor questionnaires and samples were taken from the penile epithelium and scrotum for HPV detection. HPV testing of the combined DNA extract was conducted using PCR and genotyping. Asian/Pacific Islanders had the lowest HPV prevalence of 42.2% compared to Blacks (66.2%), and Whites (71.5%). The Asian/Pacific Islander race was strongly protective in univariate analysis (prevalence ratio (PR) = 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-0.74) and multivariate analysis for any HPV infection (PR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.52-0.8). Stratified analysis by lifetime number of female partners also showed strong inverse associations with the Asian/Pacific Islander race. We consistently observed the lowest prevalence of HPV infection among Asian/Pacific Islanders with moderate inverse associations even after various adjustments for potential confounding factors. Unmeasured behavioral factors, sexual mixing with low risk women, and/or race-specific differences in the frequency of germline variations among immune regulating genes may underlie these associations. Further studies among Asian populations that incorporate measures of immuno-genetics are needed to understand this phenomenon.

Methods Men who have sex with men visiting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in Amsterdam in 2008 to 2009 answered questions concerning demographics and sexual behavior. Sera were tested for HPV antibodies to the major HPV capsid protein L1 by Luminex-based multiplex serology. As it is known that site of exposure is associated with seropositivity, this analysis was restricted to MSM who reported receptive anal sex during the preceding 6 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined whether HIV was associated with HPV serostatus. Results Included in the study were 415 HIV-negative and 205 HIV-positive MSM reporting receptive anal sex. Median age of the study population was 39 years (interquartile range, 31-44). Human papillomavirus seroprevalence differed significantly between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM: 31% versus 65% (P < 0.001) for HPV-16 and 28% versus 51% (P < 0.001) for HPV-18. After adjusting for important risk factors HPV-16 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.75-4.49) and HPV-18 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.85), seropositivity was significantly more common in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative MSM. We could not identify other consistent risk factors for HPV-16 and HPV-18 seropositivity.

Here, we describe the HPV DNA prevalence and type distribution in a series of invasive anal cancers and anal intraepithelial neoplasias (AIN) grades 2/3 from 24 countries. We analyzed 43 AIN 2/3 cases and 496 anal cancers diagnosed from 1986 to 2011. After histopathological evaluation of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, HPV DNA detection and genotyping was performed using SPF-10/DEIA/LiPA<inf>25</inf> system (version 1). A subset of 116 cancers was further tested for p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression, a cellular surrogate marker for HPV-associated transformation. Prevalence ratios were estimated using multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance in the anal cancer data set. HPV DNA was detected in 88.3% of anal cancers (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.1-91.0%) and in 95.3% of AIN 2/3 (95% CI: 84.2-99.4%). Among cancers, the highest prevalence was observed in warty-basaloid subtype of squamous cell carcinomas, in younger patients and in North American geographical region. There were no statistically significant differences in prevalence by gender. HPV16 was the most frequent HPV type detected in both cancers (80.7%) and AIN 2/3 lesions (75.4%). HPV18 was the second most common type in invasive cancers (3.6%). p16<sup>INK4a</sup> overexpression was found in 95% of HPV DNA-positive anal cancers. In view of the results of HPV DNA and high proportion of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> overexpression, infection by HPV is most likely to be a necessary cause for anal cancers in both men and women. The large contribution of HPV16 reinforces the potential impact of HPV vaccines in the prevention of these lesions. What's new? Human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked to anal cancer through high HPV DNA-detection rates. Here, in one of the largest international studies to date, HPV DNA was detected in more than 88% of anal cancers and more than 95% of anal intraepithelial neoplasias grades 2/3. HPV16 was the most frequently detected virus type, followed by HPV18. Overexpression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, a surrogate marker for HPV-associated transformation, was found in 95% of HPV-positive anal cancers.

Men play an important role in the transmission of the virus and act as a reservoir. The aim of this study was to determine the HPV-genotypes and their prevalence in a group of men attending a Sexually Transmitted Infection service. Patients and Samples: Between July 2002 and June 2011, 1392 balanopreputial, 435 urethral, 123 anal, and 67 condyloma lesions from 1551 men with a mean age of 35.8+/-11.3 years old (range: 17-87) were collected for HPV-DNA testing. Methods: A fragment of the L1-gene and a fragment of the E6/E7-genes were amplified by PCR. Positive samples were typed by hybridization. Results: The HPV genome was detected in 36.9% (486/1318) balanopreputial and in 24.9% (101/405) urethral (p<0.0001) swabs from 38.1% (538) of 1469 men. Co-infections were present in 5.4% (80/1469) of cases. HPV was found in 43.9% (373/850) of men younger than 35 vs. 31.7% (187/589) of men aged >35. HPV was found in 59.4% (104) of 165 men with lesions (macroscopic or positive peniscopy), and in 22.8% (61/267) without clinical alterations. HPV was also detected in 71.4% (40/56) men with condylomata and in 58.7% (64/109) of men with positive peniscopy. Conclusions: HPV prevalence in men was high and decreased with age. HPV was found more frequently in balanopreputial than in urethral swabs. There was a low rate of co-infections. Low-risk HPV vaccine genotypes were the most recurrent especially in younger. Although HPV has been associated with clinical alterations, it was also found in men without any clinical presentation. Inclusion of men in the national HPV vaccination program may reduce their burden of HPV-related disease and reduce transmission of the virus to non-vaccinated women. © 2013 Alvarez-Arguelles et al.","(Alvarez-Arguelles, Melon, Boga, Villa, de Ona) Servicio de Microbiologia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain (Junquera) Unidad de ITS, Hospital Monte Naranco, Oviedo, Spain (Perez-Castro) Servicio de Microbiologia, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Vigo, Vigo, Spain~M.

Sixteen (13%) participants had cytological evidence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial (HGSIL) changes, 100% of whom had high-risk HPV types detected, and 13 (10%) had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance with possible high-grade changes (ASCUS-H), 92% of whom had high-risk HPV types detected. Low-grade changes (LSIL) were detected in 24 (19%) participants, 96% of whom had high-risk HPV types, 32 (25%) had ASCUS with 88% high-risk HPV types, 30 (24%) had normal cytology with 73% high-risk HPV types, and 11 (9%) samples were inadequate for cytological assessment. The odds ratio of participants with high-risk HPV having abnormal anal cytology on anal swab was 5.03 (95% CI 1.45 to 17.39). Discussion: High-risk HPV types are common in this HIV+ population with a CD4 cell count >300 cells/mul. The presence of high-risk HPV types was associated with abnormal anal cytology such as HGSIL and ASCUS-H.","(Anderson) Carlton Clinic, Melbourne, VIC, Australia (Anderson, Hoy) Infectious Diseases Unit, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia (Hoy) Department of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia (Hillman) STI Research Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia (Gittleson, Hartel, Basser) CSL Limited, Melbourne, VIC, Australia (Medley) Melbourne Pathology, Collingwood, VIC, Australia (Anderson) Carlton Clinic, 88 Rathdowne St, Melbourne, VIC 3053, Australia~J.

METHODS: The population attributable fraction (PAF) and number of cancers caused by hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), Helicobacter pylori and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were calculated using standard formulae incorporating prevalence of infection in the Australian population, the relative risks associated with that infection and cancer incidence. For cancers with very strong associations to the infectious agent (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], human papillomavirus [HPV] and HIV/Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus [KSHV]), calculations were based on viral prevalence in the tumour. RESULTS: An estimated 3,421 cancers (2.9% of all cancers) in Australia in 2010 were attributable to infections. Infectious agents causing the largest numbers of cancers were HPV (n=1,706), H. pylori (n=793) and HBV/HCV (n=518). Cancer sites with the greatest number of cancers caused by infections were cervix (n=818), stomach (n=694) and liver (n=483). Cancers with highest proportions attributable to infectious agents were Kaposi's sarcoma (100%), cervix (100%), nasopharynx (87%), anus (84%) and vagina (70%). CONCLUSIONS: Infectious agents cause more than 3,000 cancers annually in Australia. IMPLICATIONS: Opportunities for cancer prevention through infection control are considerable, even in a 'first world' nation like Australia.

C.~Cirnes, L.~Faustino, A.~Santos, S.",Epidemiology of human papillomavirus on anogenital warts in Portugal - The HERCOLES study,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology,31,1342-1348,,,"Background: Anogenital warts (AGW) are one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Approximately, 90% of AGWs are related to infection by HPV 6 and 11. However, AGW have been associated with infection by multiple genotypes, including HR-HPV, which may be associated with a long-term increased risk of anogenital cancer. Objective: This observational prospective epidemiological study aims to estimate the type-specific HPV distribution on incident AGWs in both genders, and additionally to assess the frequency of anal and oral HPV infection in patients with AGWs. Methods: According to defined inclusion criteria, individuals with incident clinical diagnosis of AGWs were recruited in seven Portuguese Centres. HPV genotyping was performed using CLART HPV2 test. Results: Between November 2012 and March 2014, 162 women and 400 men (mean age: 34 years), were enrolled. After exclusion of patients with unqualified AGW samples, HPV was detected in 95.3% (505/530) AGW patients, 96.8% males and 91.6% females. Among men who have sex with men, HPV was detected in 98.5% patients. HPV 6 and/or HPV 11 were the most frequent genotypes (87.5%), and HPV 16 the most common HR-HPV (9.2%). Infection with HPV 6/11 and any HR-HPV was observed in 35.8% patients. HPV prevalence on the anal canal and oral mucosa was 83.1% and 15.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Incident AGWs were more frequent in males than in females. LR-HPVs were more common among males and HR-HPVs among females. HPV 6 and 11 were the most common genotypes on both genders. However, there was also a high prevalence of HR-HPVs, particularly of HPV 16. AGWs represent a clinical marker of both anal and oral HPV infections, including anal HR-HPV infections in women and men who have sex with men. The HERCOLES study could be a clue to further investigations concerning HPV burden of disease by gender and sexual behaviour.

We evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection in an HIV-positive MSM population attending our hospital. Cytological results are correlated with an HR-HPV genotype. Methods: From February 2013 to July 2014, 95 anal Thin Prep cytologies and 17 histological specimens were evaluated in 89 HIV-infected MSM. HPV detection (cobas HPV Test) was done in 78 patients. Patients with a positive cytological result were biopsied according to the recommendations of the European Society for Medical Oncology Clinical Practical Guidelines.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals are at greater risk for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anal than oropharyngeal cancers. The prevalence of anal vs oral HPV infections is higher in this population, but whether this is explained by higher incidence or persistence is unknown.Methods. Oral rinse and anal swab samples were collected semiannually from 404 HIV-infected adults in Baltimore, Maryland. Samples were tested for 37 HPV types using PGMY09/11 primers and reverse line-blot hybridization. Risk factors for HPV persistence were explored using adjusted Wei-Lin-Weissfeld models.Results. The prevalence (84% vs 28%), incidence (145 vs 31 per 1000 person-months), and 12-month persistence (54% vs 29%) were higher for anal vs oral HPV infections, respectively (each P <. 001). Heterosexual men had lower incidence of anal HPV than men who have sex with men and women, but a higher incidence of oral HPV infection (test of interaction P < 0.001). In adjusted analyses, risk factors for HPV persistence included prevalent vs incident (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-4.8) and anal vs oral HPV infections (aHR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9).Conclusions.

Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted viral infection worldwide. HPV is highly prevalent in sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) and has been associated with anal cancer, penile cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer. Methods. From March to September 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional study of HPV prevalence among MSM above age 18 years. Participants were recruited using respondent driven sampling at Clinica Cayetano Heredia. All participants provided anal, genital, and oral samples for HPV DNA testing, and blood for HIV and HPV antibody testing. Results. A total of 200 MSM were recruited in the study. The mean age was 34 years (range 18-59 years, SD = 9.4) and 101 participants were HIV negative (99 HIV positive). HPV 6/11/16/18 or quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) genotype seroprevalence among HIV negative and positive MSM was 64.3% (55%-75.9%) and 93.8%(87.6%-99.2%) respectively (p<0.001). HIV positivity was associated with a higher prevalence of HPV4 and HPV 16/18 DNA at external genital sites and the anal canal. HPV4 DNA prevalence at external genital sites among HIV negative and positive MSM was 14.9% and 28.7% (p = 0.02) respectively, at anal canal was 50.9% and 79.0% (p = 0.001), and at the oral cavity was 9.9% and 8.5% (p = 0.6). Conclusions. HPV4 seroprevalence was high in our study among both HIV positives and negatives, with HPV DNA prevalence much lower, and the anal canal being the anatomical site with the highest HPV DNA prevalence. HPV prevention interventions are needed among MSM at high-risk for HIV infection.

We conducted a large national cohort study to examine the risk of cancer among men and women with genital warts (GW). Methods. By use of the Danish National Patient Register, we identified 16,155 men and 32,933 women who received a diagnosis of GW during 1978-2008. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed as estimates of the relative risk of specific cancers or sites. Results. A diagnosis of GW was strongly related to anal (SIR for men, 21.5; SIR for women, 7.8), vulvar (SIR, 14.8), vaginal (SIR, 5.9), cervical (SIR, 1.5), penile (SIR, 8.2), and head and neck cancer (SIR, 2.8), including subsites of head and neck cancer with confirmed HPV association (SIR for men, 3.5; SIR for women, 4.8). The risks remained elevated for >10 years following GW diagnosis. In addition, we found moderately increased SIR estimates for nonmelanoma skin cancer, smoking-related cancers, and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Conclusions. Individuals with GW have a long-term increased risk of anogenital cancers and head and neck cancers. The elevated risks of nonmelanoma skin cancers might indicate an association with HPV, while excess risks of other cancers could point to differences in other risk factors between individuals with GW and the general population. © 2012 The Author.","(Blomberg, Friis, Munk, Bautz, Kjaer) Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark (Kjaer) Gynecological Clinic, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark~S.K.

Methods: A cohort of consecutively enrolled HIV-positive patients underwent, at baseline visit, a sexual behaviors questionnaire, anoscopy, HPV testing and cytological examination. Hybridization and multiplex-PCR were used for DNA detection and typing; HPV E6-E7 mRNA expression was analyzed in HR-HPV+ patients. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of HR-HPV infection and anal dysplasia. Results: 233 HIV-infected patients were enrolled (81% males, median age 44 years). HR-HPV was detected in 144 anal swabs and showed a positive association with CDC stage C and a negative association with a higher CD4 count and the use of a NNRTI-based antiretroviral regimen. HR-HPV DNA detection and anal warts at baseline were associated to cytological abnormalities; a detectable HIV-RNA independently predicted new onset anal dysplasia at follow-up (incidence 15.4 per 100 patients-year). Incidence of new HR-HPV infection was 44.2 per 100 patients-year.

The aim of this study was to report on trends of incidence and survival for anal cancer in France before the implementation of the human papilloma virus vaccine. This analysis was carried out on 1150 squamous-cell carcinomas of the anal canal diagnosed from 1989 to 2004 in a population of 5.7 million people covered by eight population-based cancer registries. Time trends in incidence were modeled using an age-period-cohort model. Net survival rates were obtained using the recently validated unbiased Pohar-Perme estimator. The incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal increased from 0.2 to 0.5/100 000 person-years among men and from 0.7 to 1.3/100 000 person-years among women from 1982 to 2012. Among women, the increase peaked after 2005, with an annual percentage change of +3.4% between 2005 and 2012, as compared with +2.6% among men. The net survival was 56% (95% confidence interval, 49-64) at 5 years and 48% (33-70) at 10 years among men. It was higher among women, at 65% (61-69) and 56% (50-63) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The prognosis improved between 1989-1997 and 1998-2004. This improvement was slightly greater for men than for women, thus progressively reducing the gap between sexes. The incidence of squamous-cell anal canal cancer increased slightly among both sexes, but the increase was more marked among women than among men. The potential benefit of prophylactic female human papilloma virus vaccination against cervical cancer in France should be further evaluated. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Design and methods: Prospective study of HIV-infected MSM who underwent screening for anal dysplasia. Screening program includes anal cytology, HPV testing, and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) at each visit. Histological samples were obtained if suspicious lesions were revealed by HRA. Sensitivity and specificity of the different tests were calculated by using histological results of HRA-guided biopsy as the reference test for HGAIN diagnosis. Results: From May 2009 to August 2016, 692 HIV-infected MSM underwent 1827 anal cytologies, 1841 HRA examinations, and 1607 HPV testing. At first screening visit, anal cytology results were abnormal in 418 (60.4%) of 692 patients, and oncogenic HPV genotypes were found in 482 (79.5%) of 606 patients. Anal cytology showed a sensitivity of 89.2% [95% confidence interval (CI); 80.7-94.2] and a specificity of 44.2% (95% CI; 40.2-48.2) to detect HGAIN. Oncogenic HPV testing had 90.4% sensitivity (95% CI; 82-86.8) and 24.4% specificity (95% CI; 20.8-28.3). Cotesting showed a 97.4% sensitivity (95% CI; 91-99.3) and 14% specificity (95% CI; 11.2-17.3). In patients with atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance on cytology, oncogenic HPV testing had 91.3% sensitivity and 28.3% specificity to detect HGAIN. Conclusion: Abnormal cytology and oncogenic HPV determination showed similar sensitivity for detecting HGAIN. The two tests used together improved the sensitivity but with lowered specificity. In our opinion, HPV testing does not improve HGAIN detection and should not replace anal cytology as a standard screening test for HIV-infected MSM.

Some studies report detection of oncogenic HPV DNA in colorectal carcinomas, with prevalence estimates as high as 84%. However, other studies report detecting no HPV DNA in colorectal tumors.~METHODS: To evaluate the prevalence of HPV in colorectal cancer subsets, we conducted a case-case comparison study. This study included 555 cases of incident colorectal cancer from the Seattle Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR), ages 20 to 74 years and diagnosed between 1998 and 2002. Standardized interviews were used to elicit demographics and risk factor data. Tumor DNA was assayed for HPV-16 and -18 DNA using real-time PCR. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status was assessed using a standard 10-marker panel and confirmed with immunohistochemical staining. Prevalence estimates were calculated for the overall sample, and stratified by patient and tumor characteristics. Fisher exact test was used to compare prevalence between strata.~RESULTS: HPV-16 DNA was detected in 2% of colorectal tumors, but no HPV-18 DNA was detected. HPV-16 prevalence did not vary between cases according to sex, age, race, smoking-status, or MSI-status (P > 0.05). HPV-16 prevalence in rectal carcinomas was 5% compared with 1% in colon carcinomas (P = 0.03).~CONCLUSIONS: Among a large sample of colorectal carcinomas, prevalence of HPV-16 and -18 was very low. Prior studies detecting high HPV prevalence in colorectal carcinomas are likely the result of contamination from the anal canal or clinical processing.~IMPACT: HPV is unlikely to play a large role in colorectal carcinogenesis.","Burnett-Hartman, Andrea N.

We used the nationwide pool of German population-based cancer registry data to estimate the burden of HPV-attributable cancer in this population for the year 2013. Methods: Incident cases of cervical cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, oropharynx (OP), as well as of the vulva, vagina and penis were classified as potentially HPV-associated and identified from the nationwide cancer registry data-pool. We calculated the incidence and proportions of cancer with potentially HPV-associated morphologies. Estimation of the HPV-attributable incidence was based on prevalence-estimates of viral DNA in tumor cells in the respective sites, as provided from the international literature. Results: From the overall 15,936 incident cases of anogenital and OP cancers in 2013, 6239 female and 1358 male cancer cases were estimated to be attributable to HPV. The majority of HPV-attributable cases were contributed by cervical cancer (70.9% of female cancers) and oropharyngeal cancer (46.9% of male cancers). Conclusions: Even if most HPV-attributable cases were contributed by cervical cancer, anogenital cancer at sites other than the cervix, and oropharyngeal cancer substantially contribute to the burden of HPV-associated cancer.

Patients with a baseline HSIL anal cytology had an estimated 5-year probability of progression to IAC of 1.7% and an estimated annual progression risk of 1 in 263. None of the examined covariates was significantly associated with IAC incidence when examined in separate unadjusted Cox models.~CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients with a baseline HSIL anal cytology had a 5-year cumulative incidence of IAC of 1.65%, with an upper 95% confidence bound of 4.5%. This population-based study provides quantitative risk estimates that may be used for counselling patients regarding management options for abnormal cytology results.","Cachay, E.

The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of HPV-16 integration in anal cytologic specimens of HIV-1 infected men and its association with risk factors. Patients methods: This cross-sectional study included 269 HIV-infected males. Detection and typing of HPV-infection was done by multiplex PCR, and integration of HPV-16 by real-time PCR. Results: The overall anal HPV-infection prevalence was 78% (209/269), 29% (77/269) for HPV-16 infection, and 9% (25/269) for HPV-16 integration. In HPV-16 infected group, the integration prevalence represented 32% (25/77). The only risk factor associated with HPV-16 integration was the time since HIV diagnosis (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.3; P = 0.010). The risk factors associated with abnormal cytology results were: HPV infection (OR = 17.8, 95% CI: 6.8-46.6), HPV-16 infection (OR = 4.6, 95% CI: 2.5-8.4), and presence of HPV-16 integrated forms (OR = 11.7, 95% CI: 1.5-93.5). Moreover, in the multivariate analysis, the HPV-16 integration continued representing the most important risk factor (OR = 20, 95% CI: 1.6-226) for anal cytologic abnormalities. Conclusion: HPV-16 infection and its integration in anal cells were highly prevalent in HIV-infected men. The assessment of HPV-16 integration rather than HPV-infection could be a good biomarker for predicting anal precancerous lesions in HIV-positive men.

Most HPV infections clear within 1-2 years, but those that persist can progress to precancer or cancer. In the United States, public health prevention of cervical cancer includes both secondary prevention through cervical cancer screening and primary prevention through HPV vaccination. Transmission of HPV also can be reduced through condom use and limiting the number of sexual partners. Two vaccines (bivalent and quadrivalent) are available to protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers. HPV 16 also is the most common HPV type found in the other five cancers often associated with HPV. To assess the incidence of HPV-associated cancers (i.e., cancers at specific anatomic sites and with specific cell types in which HPV DNA frequently is found), CDC analyzed 2004-2008 data from the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. During 2004-2008, an average of 33,369 HPV-associated cancers were diagnosed annually (rate: 10.8 per 100,000 population), including 12,080 among males (8.1 per 100,000) and 21,290 among females (13.2). Multiplying the counts for HPV-associated cancers by percentages attributable to HPV, CDC estimated that approximately 26,000 new cancers attributable to HPV occurred each year, including 18,000 among females and 8,000 among males.

Current data indicate that HPV infection is potentially associated with 90%-93% of anal cancers, 12%-63% of oropharyngeal cancers, 36%-40% of penile cancers, 40%-64% of vaginal cancers, and 40%-51% of vulvar cancers. HPV infection accounts for up to 492,800 cervical cancers and 97,215 cases of noncervical HPV-related cancers worldwide during 2002, including up to 50,780 cancers among men (13,485 anal cancers, 26,775 oropharyngeal cancers, and 10,520 penile cancers) and up to 46,435 cancers among women (14,787 anal cancers, 6,048 oropharyngeal cancers, and 25,600 vaginal/vulvar cancers). In the United States annually (1998-2003), up to 10,846 cervical cancers, 4,753 noncervical cancers among men, and 4,128 noncervical cancers among women are potentially attributable to HPV infection. Incidence rates for cervical cancer have declined significantly during the past 30 years in the United States, consistent with the success of Pap smear screening.

Risk of in situ and invasive HPV-associated cancers, compared with that in the general population, was measured by use of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated the relationship of immunosuppression with incidence during the period of 4-60 months after AIDS onset by use of CD4 T-cell counts measured at AIDS onset. Incidence during the 4-60 months after AIDS onset was compared across three periods (1980-1989, 1990-1995, and 1996-2004). All statistical tests were two-sided.ResultsAmong persons with AIDS, we observed statistically significantly elevated risk of all HPV-associated in situ (SIRs ranged from 8.9, 95% CI = 8.0 to 9.9, for cervical cancer to 68.6, 95% CI = 59.7 to 78.4, for anal cancer among men) and invasive (SIRs ranged from 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2 to 2.1, for oropharyngeal cancer to 34.6, 95% CI = 30.8 to 38.8, for anal cancer among men) cancers. During 1996-2004, low CD4 T-cell count was associated with statistically significantly increased risk of invasive anal cancer among men (relative risk [RR] per decline of 100 CD4 T cells per cubic millimeter = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.66, P =. 006) and non-statistically significantly increased risk of in situ vagina or vulva cancer (RR = 1.52, 95% CI = 0.99 to 2.35, P =. 055) and of invasive cervical cancer (RR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.80, P =. 077). Among men, incidence (per 100 000 person-years) of in situ and invasive anal cancer was statistically significantly higher during 1996-2004 than during 1990-1995 (61% increase for in situ cancers, 18.3 cases vs 29.5 cases, respectively; RR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.24 to 2.35, P <. 001; and 104% increase for invasive cancers, 20.7 cases vs 42.3 cases, respectively; RR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.54 to 2.68, P <. 001). Incidence of other cancers was stable over time.ConclusionsRisk of HPV-associated cancers was elevated among persons with AIDS and increased with increasing immunosuppression. The increasing incidence for anal cancer during 1996-2004 indicates that prolonged survival may be associated with increased risk of certain HPV-associated cancers.","(Chaturvedi, Engels) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852, United States (Madeleine) Program in Epidemiology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States (Biggar) State Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark~A.

High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) has been adopted as a cotest with anal Papanicolaou tests. We sought to identify the prevalence of HR-HPV types in the most common anal cytology specimens: negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) and atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Materials and methods: Anal cytology specimens were identified and tested for HR-HPV using Roche cobas 4800 HR-HPV analysis (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Indianapolis, Ind) and, if positive, typed further for: HPV-16, -18, and/or non-16/non-18 ""other"" HR-HPV type. Results: There were 642 specimens from 538 patients. The most common interpretation was NILM (48.6%) and ASC-US (25.7%). Of NILM cases, 47% were HR-HPV+ (53% in men, 33% in women, P = 0.03, chi<sup>2</sup>). In ASC-US cases, 73% were HR-HPV+ (74% in male patients, 70% in female patients).

In patients with non-16/non-18 HR-HPV+ anal cytology, 16 of 79 had biopsies histologically diagnosed as at least high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL+). However, the relative risk of having HSIL+ was 2.3-times higher for anal cytology positive for HPV-16, -18, with/without coinfection with non-16/non-18 HR-HPV than those positive for non-16/non-18 ""other"" HR-HPV types alone. Conclusions: Non-16/non-18 ""other"" HR-HPV types are most prevalent in anal cytology interpretations of NILM and ASC-US. Patients with HR-HPV+ NILM or ASC-US, negative for HPV-16/-18, are at lower relative risk of having subsequent histologic HSIL+, but a percentage of these patients still harbor HSIL+ on biopsy.

We describe the prevalence of anogenital HPV infection, abnormal anal cytology and anogenital warts (AGWs) in MLWH in Johannesburg, and explore whether HPV infection and receipt of antiretroviral treatment is associated with detection of abnormal anal cytology and AGWs. METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of 304 sexually-active MLWH >=18 years, who completed a questionnaire and physical examination. Genital swabs were collected from all men and intra-anal swabs from 250 (82%). Swabs were tested for HPV DNA and genotypes, and anal smears graded using the Bethesda classification. Factors associated with anogenital disease were assessed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Two thirds were receiving antiretroviral treatment, for a median 33 months (IQR = 15-58) and 54% were HIV-virologically suppressed. Only 5% reported ever having sex with men. Among 283 genital swabs with valid results, 79% had any HPV, 52% had HR-HPV and 27% had >1 HR-HPV infection. By comparison, 39% of the 227 valid intra-anal swabs had detectable HPV, 25% had any HR-HPV and 7% >1 HR infection. While most anal smears were normal (51%), 20% had ASCUS and 29% were LSIL. No cases had HSIL or cancer. Infection with >1 HR type (adjusted OR [aOR] = 2.39; 95%CI = 1.02-5.58) and alpha-9 types (aOR = 3.98; 95%CI = 1.42-11.16) were associated with having abnormal cytology. Prevalence of AGWs was 12%. Infection with any LR type (aOR = 41.28; 95%CI = 13.57-125.62), >1 LR type (aOR = 4.14; 95%CI = 1.60-10.69), being <6 months on antiretroviral treatment (aOR = 6.90; 95%CI = 1.63-29.20) and having a CD4+ count <200 cells/muL (aOR = 5.48; 95%CI: 1.60-18.78) were associated with having AGWs. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, anogenital HR-HPV infection and associated low-grade disease is common, but severe anal dysplasia was not detected. Findings reinforce the need for HPV vaccination in men for preventing both AGWs and HR-HPV infection. Given the absence of anal HSILs, however, the findings do not support the use of anal screening programmes in this population.","(Chikandiwa, Chimoyi, Pisa, Chersich, Mayaud, Delany-Moretlwe) Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (WRHI), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa (Muller, Michelow) National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa (Michelow) Department of Anatomical Pathology, Cytology Unit, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa (Mayaud) London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK",English
